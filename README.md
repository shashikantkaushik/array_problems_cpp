# Array Problems in Python

An array is a collection of similar type of data elements that are referred to by a common name. Each data element in an array is assigned a number called an index, which represents its position in the array. Arrays are widely used in programming for tasks such as storing and manipulating data.

This repository contains solved examples of array problems, which are important for developing skills in programming logic and problem-solving. The problems have been taken from various sources on the internet, and visitors are advised to first go through the problem statement and try to solve it on their own.

## Problem Solving Approach


### 1. Problem Understanding
Step 1: Understand the problem statement<br/>
Step 2: Define the input and output of the problem<br/>
Step 3: Identify the constraints of the problem


### 2. Problem Solving
Step 1: Understand the brute force solution<br/>
Step 2: Optimize the brute force solution<br/>
Step 3: Implement the optimized solution<br/>
Step 4: Test the solution


### 3. Code Optimization
Step 1: Identify the time and space complexity of the code<br/>
Step 2: Analyze the code for any redundant steps<br/>
Step 3: Optimize the code to reduce the time and/or space complexity<br/>

## Usage

Each problem is organized in a separate folder, which contains a README file describing the problem, a C++ source code file, and sometimes a sample input/output file. To compile and run the code, you can use any C++ compiler of your choice, such as gcc or Visual Studio. For example, to compile and run the code for problem 1, you can use the following commands:

1. Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your_username/array-problems-python.git


2. Navigate to the repository
$ cd array-problems-python


3. Run the Python file for the problem you want to solve
$ python3 problem1.py


4. Follow the input prompts in the terminal and get the output.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as per your needs. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to file an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
